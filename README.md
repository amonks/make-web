# make-web

These are the naterials for an online course I'm working on about making internet


I'm planning on taking 15-ish people through a year-long course on web making

It evolved from that book I thought I was writing

Over the course of 3-ish 4-ish-month-long units we'll learn all types of web

And the course is taught in terminals to a shared debian  server so we'll sneak in some sysop learning as well.
