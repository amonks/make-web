# make-web

These are the naterials for an online course I'm working on about making internet


I'm planning on taking 15-ish people through a year-long course on web making

It evolved from that book I thought I was writing

Over the course of 3-ish 4-ish-month-long units we'll learn all types of web

And the course is taught in terminals to a shared debian  server so we'll sneak in some sysop learning as well.

## Outline

* jekyll

* gh-pages

* github

* heroku

* ruby, rbenv, gems

* html

* css

* haml, templating

* grunt?

* npm, bower

* databases

## Intro

I love the internet. It's awesome. You love it too. It's 2014. You prolly spend all day on the internet with your apple watch and your fancyphone.

Everybody always talks about how the internet democratizes shit. Turns consumers into proudcers. It's true. Making internet is hella easier than making, for example, books. You have the tools in front of you to make some right now for free, while you couldn't make a book without spending some dough. But your average person knows more about how to make a book than an internet.

Let's get to the democratizing, then, shall we?

In part one, we'll make a proper-looking webslice and put it online (for free!) so your friends and enemies can gaze upon it in wonder.

In part two, we'll make a blog. We'll talk about things like and templating and making a change in one place affect multiple pages of the website.

In part three, we'll get real fancy and start making webapps. Yup. You heard me. You can zuckerburg right up and stack a few mil. We'll talk about things like databases and server side code. And having multiple users.

In part four we'll up our JavaScript game, pull up our sleeves, and make some net art. We'll talk about 3d and animations and interactivity. We might even kick it old skool and generate some text.

It'll be fun.

## Part One: static

This is *Part One*. We'll build a static website, and get familiar with a text editor, HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, the Terminal, and the website Github. This guide assumes you're on a Mac, and using Yosemite. It'll probably work in Mavericks, too.


### Quick intro on how websites work.

When your browser visits a web page, it gets an `HTML` file. In some cases, all the code that makes up the page is contained within that one file, but more often that `HTML` file will link to other things files like images, videos, scripts, or style sheets.

One of the coolest things about the internet is that you can examine all of the source code that your web browser gets.

### View Source

Let's try it. If you're using Safari, you'll have to go into Preferences and enable `Show Develop menu in menu bar`, under `Advanced`.

On any website, you can now open the Develop menu, and hit `Show Page Source` to open up the `HTML` code that your browser is rendering and displaying.

### Editing



### Text editor, basic setup

The first step towards making a website is getting a programmer's text editor. I use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). I've also used and enjoyed [GitHub Atom](https://atom.io/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), [Panic Coda](https://panic.com/coda/), and [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). There are tons of great options available, and they all do fundamentally the same thing.

### Opening a folder in Sublime Text.

I'll put Sublime Text on my Dock.

You'll need to make a folder to put your website into. I'm just putting mine on my Desktop, but anywhere is fine.

Drag the folder onto the Sublime Text icon in your Dock.

> protip: if Sublime Text is open, you can hold `command` and press `tab` to bring up a Sublime Text icon you can drag folders onto, even if it isn't in your Dock.
