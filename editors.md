There are many programmer's text editors you can install on your computer. They all do more or less the same thing.

## mac

I use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). I've also used and enjoyed [GitHub Atom](https://atom.io/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), [Panic Coda](https://panic.com/coda/), and [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). There are tons of great options available, and they all do fundamentally the same thing.

### Opening a folder in Sublime Text.

I'll put Sublime Text on my Dock.

You'll need to make a folder to put your website into. I'm just putting mine on my Desktop, but anywhere is fine.

Drag the folder onto the Sublime Text icon in your Dock.

> protip: if Sublime Text is open, you can hold `command` and press `tab` to bring up a Sublime Text icon you can drag folders onto, even if it isn't in your Dock.

## windows

try notepad++

## linux

try gedit

## on the server

There are several popular text editors that you can use on the server right from your Terminal.

The simplest one is called `nano`. I talk about briefly in [programs](programs).

Eventually, someone might tell you to use `vim` or `emacs`. You don't need complicated shit like that in your life. Just use Sublime Text (or whatever). Maybe try `vim` in a few years when you can make a website faster than a ham sandwich and you're looking for ways to make it harder.
