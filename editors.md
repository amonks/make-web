# Text editors

There are many programmer's text editors you can install on your computer. They all do more or less the same thing.

## mac

I use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). I've also used and enjoyed [GitHub Atom](https://atom.io/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), [Panic Coda](https://panic.com/coda/), and [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). There are tons of great options available, and they all do fundamentally the same thing.

## windows

try notepad++

## linux

try gedit





### Opening a folder in Sublime Text.

I'll put Sublime Text on my Dock.

You'll need to make a folder to put your website into. I'm just putting mine on my Desktop, but anywhere is fine.

Drag the folder onto the Sublime Text icon in your Dock.

> protip: if Sublime Text is open, you can hold `command` and press `tab` to bring up a Sublime Text icon you can drag folders onto, even if it isn't in your Dock.
