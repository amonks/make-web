# GitHub

There are many viable ways of moving files between your computer and the server. We're going to use a program called `git`, because you'll have to learn it before too long anyway.

In general, `Git` lets you set up a folder on your computer as a `git repository`. It'll then let you keep track of any changes in that folder, `push` those changes to a copy of the git repository on another computer, or `pull` changes from there.

For our purposes, we'll be using the popular website GitHub as an intermediary between the server and your computer. If you edit a file on your computer, you'll push it to GitHub, log into the server, and `pull` it from GitHub.

This all sounds complicated, but we'll get through it.

## Create a GitHub account and set up Git

Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account.

Once you've done that, follow their instructions for [setting up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/). Since we're using SSH anyway, continue onto the article on [generating SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).
