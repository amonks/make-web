When your browser visits a web page, it gets an `HTML` file. In some cases, all the code that makes up the page is contained within that one file, but more often that `HTML` file will link to other things files like images, videos, scripts, or style sheets.

One of the coolest things about the internet is that you can examine all of the source code that your web browser gets.

### View Source

Let's try it. If you're using Safari, you'll have to go into Preferences and enable `Show Develop menu in menu bar`, under `Advanced`.

On any website, you can now open the Develop menu, and hit `Show Page Source` to open up the `HTML` code that your browser is rendering and displaying.
