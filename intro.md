This is not for you if:

## Intro

I love the internet. It's awesome. You love it too. It's 2014. You prolly spend all day on the internet with your apple watch and your fancyphone.

Everybody always talks about how the internet democratizes shit. Turns consumers into proudcers. It's true. Making internet is hella easier than making, for example, books. You have the tools in front of you to make some right now for free, while you couldn't make a book without spending some dough. But your average person knows more about how to make a book than an internet.

Let's get to the democratizing, then, shall we?

In part one, we'll make a proper-looking webslice and put it online (for free!) so your friends and enemies can gaze upon it in wonder.

In part two, we'll make a blog. We'll talk about things like and templating and making a change in one place affect multiple pages of the website.

In part three, we'll get real fancy and start making webapps. Yup. You heard me. You can zuckerburg right up and stack a few mil. We'll talk about things like databases and server side code. And having multiple users.

In part four we'll up our JavaScript game, pull up our sleeves, and make some net art. We'll talk about 3d and animations and interactivity. We might even kick it old skool and generate some text.

It'll be fun.
