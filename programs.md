## cowsay

Cowsay is a classic (but mostly useless) utility for making a cow say stuff. Try running `cowsay Hi dude!`

As simple as it is, cowsay gives us the opportunity to learn about a few Unix conventions. For example, cowsay let's you use what are called 'flags' to select various options. For example, typing `cowsay -d oops` will produce a dead cow saying 'oops'. Likewise, `cowsay -s sweet doobie bro` will result in a stoned looking cow.

You can learn about other options in the  cowsay manual, which you can read by running `man cowsay`.

## man

The `man` command is super useful. You can use it to pull up a super-long-winded explanation of the workings of almost any program on the server.

## lynx

Lynx is a super old-school text-based web browser. It's an amusing introduction to text based computing. From the prompt on the server, you can type `lynx` to open the browser to a blank page, or something like `lynx http://monks.co` to open a particular website.

Lynx uses a convention you'll see a lot: a row of commands at the bottom, indicating a letter on the keyboard to trigger each command. For example, you can press the `g` key to `go` to another URL.

## Nano

Nano is a very common, very simple text editor. You'll find it installed on your Mac too. You'll see that the commands at the bottom include a `^` symbol. It's a standard way of representing the control (*not* command) key.

Type just `nano` to open a blank document in the current working directory, or, for example `nano make-web/programs.md` to open a particular file.
